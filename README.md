A Script using the vbscript, autoIT com component, &amp; chrome to change your Google password 99 times.

99 times because Google has a 99 password history. So if you want to change your google password back to an old one - this is the answer.

Tip: Don't just doubleclick it to run it. Close *everything*. Open a command prompt. THEN run it from the command prompt. 

That way, if it barfs, you can see what the password is set to.

Some SEO reasons why you want to use this to maybe help people find this:
